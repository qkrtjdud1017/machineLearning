    "The goal of this first notebook is to explore logistic regression and feature engineering with sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Pandas Dataframe to do some feature engineering\n",
    "* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.\n",
    "* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.\n",
    "* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.\n",
    "* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the **accuracy** of the model.\n",
    "* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.\n",
    "* Compare multiple logistic regression models.\n",
