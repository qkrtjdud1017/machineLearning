    "* <span style=\"color:red\">Read & post to this [Assignment 5 Clarifications](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1271722/discussion_topics/4817620) if you are not sure of something.</span>\n",
    "* Many of you have confusion on why some of your homeworks do not get full credit when you think you submitted the correct answer.\n",
    "    * Well, the answer is simple. If there's Free Response questions, we need to give credit after we manually look at your response.\n",
    "    * So yeah, don't panic. It's okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "* When exploring a large set of documents -- such as Wikipedia, news articles, StackOverflow, etc. -- it can be useful to get a list of related material. \n",
    "* To find relevant documents you typically:\n",
    "    * Decide on a notion of similarity\n",
    "    * Find the documents that are most similar \n",
    " \n",
    "### Method & Summary\n",
    "* In the assignment you will:\n",
    "    * Gain intuition for different notions of similarity and practice finding similar documents. \n",
    "    * Explore the tradeoffs with representing documents using raw word counts and TF-IDF\n",
    "    * Explore the behavior of different distance metrics by looking at the Wikipedia pages most similar to President Obama’s page.\n",
    "\n",

    "* It says in the documentation it \"Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts\", but what does this mean?\n",
    "* Naturally, what we think of doing is to make a dictionary of word counts, \n",
    "    * So let's say for \"bound le s s boi\" you will have a dictionary of {bound:1, le: 1, s:2, boi:1}\n",
    "    * But imagine we do that for many words in many texts...\n",
    "        * That is a lot of different vectors in a lot of dictionaries! \n",
    "        * 59071 of them! And they take a lot of spaceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee🌌\n",
    "        * But more importantly, such data structure is very inefficient when it comes to querying.\n",
    "    * But this does NOT mean it is useless. We will see them later in this homework.\n",
    "* So to store them efficiently and make them easy to query, we will tokenize these vectors and put them into a matrix.\n",
    "    * Namely, we don't store individual dictionaries in each row, but make a list of names and align them to a matrix's column. \n",
    "    * What does this matrix look like? Think if we have a matrix with each column for a word, and each row for an article, take a second to think how crowded this matrix might look like.\n",
    "        * Not very croweded, right? \n",
    "        * For example, the column for 'obama' will only have a value if that human is obama-related.\n",
    "        * Say we take Queen Victoria, she doesn't know Obama, she isn't even an American and not to mention she is dead many years before Obama is born, so I guess her 'obama' column very likely be zero. Same for many, many other humans. We call a matrix with many zeroes \"sparse\". \n",
