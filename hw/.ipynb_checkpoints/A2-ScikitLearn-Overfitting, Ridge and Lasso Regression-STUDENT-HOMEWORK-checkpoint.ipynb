    "### Purpose\n",
    "* We will run ridge regression multiple times with different L2 penalties to see which one produces the best fit. \n",
    "* We will revisit the example of polynomial regression as a means to see the effect of L2 regularization. \n",
    "* We will also use LASSO to select features.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Method & Summary\n",
    "* Use a pre-built implementation of regression to run polynomial regression\n",
    "* Use matplotlib to visualize polynomial regressions\n",
    "* Use a pre-built implementation of regression to run polynomial regression, this time with L2 penalty\n",
    "* Use matplotlib to visualize polynomial regressions under L2 regularization\n",
    "* Run LASSO with different L1 penalties.\n",
    "* Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set.\n",
    "* We will continue to use the House data from previous notebooks.\n",

    "> If you have any questions or you are unclear what we are refering to in this homework, please do not hesitate to reach out! Post a discussion and we would love to listen to and answer your questions. However, keep in mind that figuring out what to do by reading documentation is one of the biggest things we want you to take walking out from this course. This is the first time we are offering this homework (We rewrote the entire series of CSE416 homework this quarter), and I may just made a mistake somewhere without noticing it. Your feedback is extremely important to us! Hope you enjoy this assignment :)"

Feel free to read more about them - I hope this saves a bit time for you finding documentations. I also sometimes include links to documentations of a specific function in comments and prompts (**You don't have to read them or watch them**) just to make it easier for you to understand what we are using and what to do with this new programming language. \n",

    "## Ridge Regression comes to the rescue\n",

    "Generally, whenever we see weights change so much in response to change in data, we believe the variance of our estimate to be large. Ridge regression aims to address this issue by penalizing \"large\" weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the function that you wrote before to, with the argument `l2_penalty=l2_large_penalty`, fit a 15th-order polynomial model on `set_1`, `set_2`, `set_3`, and `set_4`. Other than the change in the `l2_penalty` parameter, the code should be the same as the experiment above. \n",

    "\n",
    "(For the purpose of answering this question, negative numbers are considered \"smaller\" than positive numbers. So -5 is smaller than -3, and -3 is smaller than 5 and so forth.)\n",
